## ACML

### Description
ACML provides a free set of thoroughly optimized 
and threaded math routines for HPC, scientific, 
engineering and related compute-intensive applications. 
ACML is ideal for weather modeling, computational fluid 
dynamics, financial analysis, oil and gas applications and more.

ACML consists of the following main components:

 * A full implementation of Level 1, 2 and 3 Basic Linear 
 Algebra Subroutines (BLAS), with key routines optimized for 
 high performance on AMD Opteronâ„¢ processors.
 * A full suite of Linear Algebra (LAPACK) routines. 
 As well as taking advantage of the highly-tuned 
 BLAS kernels, a key set of LAPACK routines has been 
 further optimized to achieve considerably higher 
 performance than standard LAPACK implementations.
 * A comprehensive suite of Fast Fourier Transforms 
 (FFTs) in both single-, double-, single-complex and 
 double-complex data types.
 * Random Number Generators in both single- and double-precision.
